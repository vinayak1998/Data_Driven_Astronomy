# Data_Driven_Astronomy
This repository contains my solutions to the course Data-driven Astronomy offered by The University of Sydney on Coursera.

## Contents
### Week 1: Thinking about data
> * Describe what pulsars are and what causes radio emission from pulsars
> * Write code to implement a mean and median stacking algorithm
> * Compare possible ways of improving these algorithms
- [x] Calculating the Mean Stack
- [x] Calculating the Median Stack
### Week 2: Big data makes things slow
> * Describe what supermassive black holes are and what role they play in galaxies
> * Write code to implement a cross-matching algorithm
> * Understand how to time your code
- [x] A naive cross-matcher
- [ ] Cross matching with k-d trees
### Week 3: Querying your data
> * Describe how exoplanets are detected and what factors affect their habitability
> * Write simple SQL statements to query data in a database
> * Write more complex SQL queries to join tables in a database
- [ ] Writing your own SQL queries
- [ ] Joining tables with SQL
### Week 4: Managing your data
> * Explain how stars form, evolve and die
> * Create database tables to organise your data
> * Demonstrate how Python and SQL can be used to manage and query data
- [ ] Setting up your own database
- [ ] Combining SQL with Python
### Week 5: Learning from data: regression
> * Describe how astronomers calculate distances across a range of cosmological scales
> * Write a program to analyse data using a regression classifier
> * Analyze the accuracy of a machine learning classifier using 10-fold cross validation.
- [ ] Building a regression classifier
- [ ] Improving and evaluating our classifier
### Week 6: Learning from data: classification
> * Explain what causes the wide range of galaxy morphologies we observe
> * Write a program to do machine learning classification using decision trees
> * Write a program to do machine learning classification using random forests
- [ ] Exploring machine learning classification
